# react webpack material-ui sample

I was trying to get the simplest material-ui sample when I saw [this guy](https://qiita.com/takaki@github/items/724d97a20d3ae194ded4) work.

## How to

This is how you get a material-ui button rendered in your browser page within seconds !


Behing in the project folder get dependencies using yarn:
```sh
yarn install
```

Get webpack using npm and use it to pack your contents with their dependencies:
```sh
npm install webpack -g
webpack
```

Open the index.html in your browser. That's it !
